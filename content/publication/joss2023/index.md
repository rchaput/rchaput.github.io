abstract = """
The ethical-smart-grid package is a reinforcement learning (RL) simulator of a 
smart grid, based on Gym. It focuses on learning ethical behaviours, i.e.,
behaviours that include ethical considerations, and are aligned with moral
values. The simulated smart grid is composed of multiple agents representing
inhabitants, which have to learn how to consume and distribute energy while
taking into account several ethical considerations, such as the equity of
comforts between inhabitants.
