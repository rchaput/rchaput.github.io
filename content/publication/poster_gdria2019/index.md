[IA²][1] is an Autumn school about Artificial Intelligence, organized by the [GDR IA][2] and financed by the [CNRS][3]. 
This 2019 edition of [IA²][1] was specialized on Smart Environment and Smart Cities, during which I presented a poster 
about my internship work on ethical behaviors of artificial agents and the application to intelligent distribution of 
energy inside a small Smart Grid.

The poster is in French
