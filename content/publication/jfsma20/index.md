abstract = """
The increase in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in 
applications impacting human users and actors has, as a direct consequence, 
the need for endowing these AI systems with ethical behaviors. While several
approaches already exist, the question of adaptability to changes in contexts, 
users behaviors or preferences still remains open. We propose to tackle this 
question using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning of ethical behavior
in different situations using Q-Tables and Dynamic Self-Organizing Maps to 
allow dynamic learning of the representation of the environment’s state and 
reward functions to prescribe ethical behaviors. To evaluate this proposal, we
developed a simulator of intelligent management of energy distribution in Smart 
Grids, evaluating different rewards functions to trigger ethical behaviors. 
Results show the ability to adapt to different conditions. Besides contributions
on ethical adaptation, we compare our model to other learning approaches and 
show it performs better than a Deep Learning one (based on Actor-Critic).
