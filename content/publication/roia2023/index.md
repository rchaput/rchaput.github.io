abstract = """
To answer the need to imbue Artificial Intelligence algorithms with ethical
considerations, this article propose a method combining reasoning and learning,
where judging agents evaluate the ethics of learning agents’ behavior. This
separation offers several advantages: co-construction between agents and humans;
judges more accessible for non-experts humans; richer feedback by using multiple
judgments. Experiments on energy distribution inside a Smart Grid simulator show
the learning agents’ ability to comply with judging agents’ rules, including
when they evolve.
