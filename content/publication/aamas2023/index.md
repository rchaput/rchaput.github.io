abstract = """
An increasing number of socio-technical systems embedding Artificial
Intelligence (AI) technologies are deployed, and questions arise about the
possible impact of such systems onto humans. We propose a hybrid multi-agent
Reinforcement Learning framework consists of learning agents that learn a
task-oriented behaviour defined by a set of symbolic moral judging agents to
ensure they respect moral values. This framework is applied on the problem of
responsible energy distribution for smart grids.
"""

summary = """
Paper presented at the *Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems* conference.
It presents the *AJAR* framework, which uses argumentation-based judging agents
to provide rewards for Reinforcement Learning agents, according to one or
several moral values. This \"judgment of ethics\" is used to nudge the learning
agents towards an \"ethical behavior\", that is, a behavior aligned with the
given moral values.
