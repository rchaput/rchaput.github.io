abstract = """
The need to imbue Artificial Intelligence algorithms with ethical 
considerations is more and more present. Combining reasoning and 
learning, this paper proposes a hybrid method, where judging agents 
evaluate the ethics of learning agents' behavior. The aim is to 
improve the ethics of their behavior in dynamic multi-agent 
environments. Several advantages ensue from this separation: possibility 
of co-construction between agents and humans; judging agents more 
accessible for non-experts humans; adoption of several points of view 
to judge the same agent, producing a richer feedback. Experiments on 
energy distribution inside a Smart Grid simulator show the learning 
agents' ability to comply with judging agents' rules, including when 
they evolve.
"""

summary = """
Paper on the ability to use a symbolic reasoning approach to judge 
neural learning agents, in order to reward them appropriately with
respect to their 'ethical' behavior, combining both approaches
in a Hybrid method.
