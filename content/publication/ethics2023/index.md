abstract = """
This short paper focuses on understanding moral dilemmas, Artificial Moral
Advisors, and their possible roles in ethical decision-making. After a brief
analysis of the philosophical debate around dilemmas, we propose three different
classes of dilemmas. We then discuss how AI-based advisors could be used to
enhance human ethical decision-making, with a particular focus on three possible
AI skills (identifying, presenting and settling dilemmas), as well as on their
role as ethical experts. The resulting proposal opens up to new possible uses
of AI moral advisors, and to the help they might offer in difficult decisions.
