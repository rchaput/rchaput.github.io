The international research movement on "Explicable Artificial Intelligence" has
developed considerably in recent years, and most conferences in the field now
offer sessions on the subject, while groups are forming around the acronym XAI.
The urgency of this research has become apparent with the extraordinary impact
on society of "artificial intelligences", and even more so when these "AIs" are
the result of learning from massive data, and even more so, if possible, when
the learning process exploits techniques known as "deep learning".
