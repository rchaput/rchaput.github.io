The numerous deployed Artificial Intelligence systems need to be aligned with
our ethical considerations. However, such ethical considerations might change
as time passes: our society is not fixed, and our social mores evolve. This
makes it difficult for these AI systems; in the Machine Ethics field especially,
it has remained an under-studied challenge. In this paper, we present two
algorithms, named QSOM and QDSOM, which are able to adapt to changes in the
environment, and especially in the reward function, which represents the ethical
considerations that we want these systems to be aligned with. They associate
the well-known Q-Table to (Dynamic) Self-Organizing Maps to handle the continuous
and multi-dimensional state and action spaces. We evaluate them on a use-case of
multi-agent energy repartition within a small Smart Grid neighborhood, and prove
their ability to adapt, and their higher performance compared to baseline
Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Preprint describing two Reinforcement Learning algorithms (*Q-SOM* and *Q-DSOM*)
I have developped. They focus on continuous and multi-dimensional observations
and actions, and adaptation to changes in the environment.
