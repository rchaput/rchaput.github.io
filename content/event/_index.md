# We want the 'archive page' (which lists all talks/events) to be accessed through
# the 'https://.../talk/' URL, in addition to 'https://.../event/' .
# Events themselves are already accessed through 'https://.../talk/my-super-talk',
# thanks to the config's permalinks (see config.yaml).
# We need this directory to be named 'event' so that the proper view is used.

# Optional header image (relative to `static/media/` folder).
