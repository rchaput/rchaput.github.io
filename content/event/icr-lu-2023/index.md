abstract: >
  Increasingly numerous AI systems have been deployed from labs to our society, with an important impact over human
  (daily) lives, especially with respect to ethical considerations. The field of Machine Ethics has proposed several
  approaches to embed such considerations within the decision-making mechanisms of artificial agents. In this
  presentation, I briefly summarize the state of the art, focusing particularly on normative systems, before presenting
  the AJAR framework, which leverages argumentation to judge reinforcement learning agents. Finally, I present an
  extension towards putting human users in the loop and settling dilemmas.
