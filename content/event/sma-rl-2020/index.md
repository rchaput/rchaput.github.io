A short talk based on a paper I read, discussing Reinforcement Learning and Artificial General Intelligence, by
S.A. Alexander.
This talk was given at a seminar of the SMA team (now renamed [SyCoSMA](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/sycosma)), at
the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr) lab.

The paper:

Samuel Allen Alexander. “The Archimedean trap: Why traditional reinforcement learning will probably not yield AGI”. 
In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.10221 (2020).
