abstract: >
  As AI systems are increasingly deployed into our society, they raise several concerns, notably in terms of
  privacy, biases, unexplainable decisions, and non-aligned objectives. In this presentation, I specifically focus
  on Machine Learning and explain what are those concerns, along with a few examples, and what are some solutions.
  These solutions include technical advances, but most importantly the need for human reflection within the design
  of such systems.
