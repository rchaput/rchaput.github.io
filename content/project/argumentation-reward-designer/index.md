**Argumentation Reward Designer** (ARD) is a tool that helps to create
reward functions based on argumentation graphs. It builds upon the [AJAR]
library and provides a visual interface to design the graphs, by placing and
moving arguments on a grid, and drawing attacks between them.

Graphs can then be exported to JSON, PNG (for sharing a visual representation
of the graph), or Python code (which can be used in 
{{< ref "/project/ethical-smartgrid/index.md" >}}).
