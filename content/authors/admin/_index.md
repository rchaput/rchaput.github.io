I am a PhD Studient in Artificial Intelligence, currently working at the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) lab (CNRS - UMR5205).
My thesis is focused on learning ethical behaviors for Artificial Agents through Reinforcement Learning.

My research interests also include Explainable AI, and human-centered AI (such as Responsible AI, AI4People, etc.).
