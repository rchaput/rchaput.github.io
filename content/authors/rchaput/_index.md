I am a PhD in Computer Science, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics.

See my [PhD Thesis]({{< ref "/publication/phd_thesis/index.md" >}}).

I am an Associate Professor, currently working at [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr/en/),
and the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) lab (CNRS - UMR5205), in the 
[Cognitive Systems and Multi-Agent Systems (SyCoSMA)](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/sycosma) team.

My research interests also include Explainable AI, and human-centered AI
(such as Responsible AI, AI4People, etc.).
