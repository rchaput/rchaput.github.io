I am a PhD in Computer Science, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics.

See my [PhD Thesis]({{< ref "/publication/phd_thesis/index.md" >}}).

<!--
I am a PhD Student in Artificial Intelligence, currently working at the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) lab
(CNRS - UMR5205), in the [Cognitive Systems and Multi-Agent Systems (SyCoSMA)](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/sycosma) 
team. My thesis focuses on learning ethical behaviors for Artificial Agents through Reinforcement Learning.
-->

My research interests also include Explainable AI, and human-centered AI (such as Responsible AI, AI4People, etc.).
